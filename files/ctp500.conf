# CTP500 Thermal Printer Configuration
#
# This file contains default configuration values for the CTP500 CUPS backend.
# Location: /usr/local/etc/ctp500.conf
#
# Note: The BLE device address is NOT stored here - it comes from the CUPS
# device URI (e.g., ctp500://AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF or ctp500://UUID)
#

# BLE Write Characteristic UUID
# This is the BLE characteristic UUID used for writing data to the printer.
# Default value works for CTP500 printers - only change if you have a different model.
WRITE_UUID="49535343-8841-43f4-a8d4-ecbe34729bb3"

# BLE Chunk Size
# Maximum number of bytes to send in a single BLE write operation.
# Smaller values are safer but slower. Larger values are faster but may fail
# on some BLE adapters or printers.
# Recommended range: 20-512 bytes
# Default: 180 bytes (good balance of speed and reliability)
CHUNK_SIZE="180"

# Font Path (for text printing)
# Path to TrueType/OpenType font file used when rendering text to images.
# If not specified, the CLI will use system defaults.
# Example: FONT_PATH="/System/Library/Fonts/Menlo.ttc"
#FONT_PATH=""

# Font Size (for text printing)
# Default font size in points when rendering text.
# Default: 12
#FONT_SIZE="12"

# Paper Width (in pixels at 203 DPI)
# For 80mm paper: ~640 pixels (80mm * 203dpi / 25.4mm/inch)
# For 58mm paper: ~460 pixels (58mm * 203dpi / 25.4mm/inch)
# The CLI will auto-resize images to fit this width.
# Default: printer hardware default (typically 80mm)
#PAPER_WIDTH_PX="640"

# BLE Connection Timeout
# How long to wait (in seconds) when connecting to the printer.
# Default: 10 seconds
#CONNECT_TIMEOUT="10"

# Write Delay
# Delay in seconds between BLE write operations.
# Increase this if you experience transmission errors.
# Default: 0.02 seconds (20ms)
#WRITE_DELAY="0.02"
